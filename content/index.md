Hi! I'm Shreyas, a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Waterloo interested in distributed systems, operating systems, and event-driven computing. I'm currently working on task scheduling services @AWS.

One part of my job that I love is knowledge sharing. Breaking down a convoluted, technical problem into something anyone can understand is great. Some of the best technical content I've come across is from authors that are really good at doing this:

1. PhilippÂ Oppermann's well known ["Writing an OS in rust"](https://os.phil-opp.com/ ) series.
2. Casey Muratori's recent but incredible ["Performance-aware Programming"](https://www.computerenhance.com/p/welcome-to-the-performance-aware) course.

I want to achieve the same clarity and effectiveness in conveying technical ideas as these creators. Over the next few months, I hope to publish high quality technical content that others can learn from, and hopefully enjoy reading :). The quality of the content is obviously limited by my expertise in the area, but I will do my best to add disclaimers wherever appropriate.
